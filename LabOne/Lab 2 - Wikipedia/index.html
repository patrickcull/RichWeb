			<p>Defeasible reasoning is a kind of reasoning that is based on
				reasons that are defeasible, as opposed to the indefeasible reasons
				of deductive logic. Defeasible reasoning is a particular kind of
				non-demonstrative reasoning, where the reasoning does not produce a
				full, complete, or final demonstration of a claim, i.e., where
				fallibility and corrigibility of a conclusion are acknowledged. In
				other words defeasible reasoning produces a contingent statement or
				claim. Other kinds of non-demonstrative reasoning are probabilistic
				reasoning, inductive reasoning, statistical reasoning, abductive
				reasoning, and paraconsistent reasoning. Defeasible reasoning is
				also a kind of ampliative reasoning because its conclusions reach
				beyond the pure meanings of the premises. The differences between
				these kinds of reasoning correspond to differences about the
				conditional that each kind of reasoning uses, and on what premise
				(or on what authority) the conditional is adopted:</p>

		<ul>
			<li><i>Deductive</i> (from meaning postulate, axiom, or contingent assertion): if p then q (i.e., q or not-p)</li>
			<li><i>Defeasible</i> (from authority): if p then (defeasibly) q</li>
			<li><i>Probabilistic</i> (from combinatorics and indifference): if p then (probably) q</li>
			<li><i>Statistical</i> (from data and presumption): the frequency of qs among ps is high (or inference from a model fit to data); hence, (in the right context) if p then (probably) q</li>
			<li><i>Inductive</i> (theory formation; from data, coherence, simplicity, and confirmation): (inducibly) "if p then q"; hence, if p then (deducibly-but-revisably) q</li>
			<li><i>Abductive</i> (from data and theory): p and q are correlated, and q is sufficient for p; hence, if p then (abducibly) q as cause</li>

			<h2>History</h2>
		</header>
		<p>
			Though Aristotle differentiated the forms of reasoning that are valid for logic and philosophy from the more general ones that are used in everyday life (see dialectics and rhetoric), 20th century philosophers mainly concentrated on deductive reasoning. At the end of the 19th century, logic texts would typically survey both demonstrative and non-demonstrative reasoning, often giving more space to the latter. However, after the blossoming of mathematical logic at the hands of Bertrand Russell, Alfred North Whitehead and Willard van Orman Quine, latter-20th century logic texts paid little attention to the non-deductive modes of inference.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			There are several notable exceptions. John Maynard Keynes wrote his dissertation on non-demonstrative reasoning, and influenced the thinking of Ludwig Wittgenstein on this subject. Wittgenstein, in turn, had many admirers, including the positivist legal scholar H.L.A. Hart and the speech act linguist John L. Austin, Stephen Toulmin in rhetoric (Chaim Perelman too), the moral theorists W.D. Ross and C.L. Stevenson, and the vagueness epistemologist/ontologist Friedrich Waismann.
		</p>
		<p>
			The etymology of defeasible usually refers to Middle English law of contracts, where a condition of defeasance is a clause that can invalidate or annul a contract or deed. Though defeat, dominate, defer, defy, deprecate and derogate are often used in the same contexts as defeasible, the verbs annul and invalidate (and nullify, overturn, rescind, vacate, repeal, debar, void, cancel, countermand, preempt, etc.) are more properly correlated with the concept of defeasibility than those words beginning with the letter d. Many dictionaries do contain the verb, to defease with past participle, defeased.
		</p>
		<p>
			Philosophers in moral theory and rhetoric had taken defeasibility largely for granted when American epistemologists rediscovered Wittgenstein's thinking on the subject: John Ladd, Roderick Chisholm, Roderick Firth, Ernest Sosa, Robert Nozick, and John L. Pollock all began writing with new conviction about how appearance as red was only a defeasible reason for believing something to be red. More importantly Wittgenstein's orientation toward language-games (and away from semantics) emboldened these epistemologists to manage rather than to expurgate prima facie logical inconsistency.
		</p>
		<p>
			At the same time (in the mid-1960s), two more students of Hart and Austin at Oxford, Brian Barry and David Gauthier, were applying defeasible reasoning to political argument and practical reasoning (of action), respectively. Joel Feinberg and Joseph Raz were beginning to produce equally mature works in ethics and jurisprudence informed by defeasibility.
		</p>
		<p>
			By far the most significant works on defeasibility by the mid-1970s were in epistemology, where John Pollock's 1974 Knowledge and Justification popularized his terminology of undercutting and rebutting (which mirrored the analysis of Toulmin). Pollock's work was significant precisely because it brought defeasibility so close to philosophical logicians. The failure of logicians to dismiss defeasibility in epistemology (as Cambridge's logicians had done to Hart decades earlier) landed defeasible reasoning in the philosophical mainstream
		</p>
		<p>
			Defeasibility had always been closely related to argument, rhetoric, and law, except in epistemology, where the chains of reasons, and the origin of reasons, were not often discussed. Nicholas Rescher's Dialectics is an example of how difficult it was for philosophers to contemplate more complex systems of defeasible reasoning. This was in part because proponents of informal logic became the keepers of argument and rhetoric while insisting that formalism was anathema to argument.

			<h2>Political and Judicial Use</h2>
		</header>
		
		<p>
			Many political philosophers have been fond of the word indefeasible when referring to rights, e.g., that were inalienable, divine, or indubitable. For example, in the 1776 Virginia Declaration of Rights, "community hath an indubitable, inalienable, and indefeasible right to reform, alter or abolish government..." (also attributed to James Madison); and John Adams, "The people have a right, an indisputable, unalienable, indefeasible, divine right to that most dreaded and envied kind of knowledge - I mean of the character and conduct of their rulers." Also, Lord Aberdeen: "indefeasible right inherent in the British Crown" and Gouverneur Morris: "the Basis of our own Constitution is the indefeasible Right of the People." Scholarship about Abraham Lincoln often cites these passages in the justification of secession. Philosophers who use the word defeasible have historically had different world views from those who use the word indefeasible (and this distinction has often been mirrored by Oxford and Cambridge zeitgeist); hence it is rare to find authors who use both words.

			<h2>Specifity</h2>
		</header>
		
		<p>
			One of the main disputes among those who produce systems of defeasible reasoning is the status of a rule of specificity. In its simplest form, it is the same rule as subclass inheritance preempting class inheritance:
		</p>
		
		<aside>
			(R1) if p then (defeasibly) q                  e.g., if penguin then not-flies <br>
			(R2) if r then (defeasibly) not-q              e.g., if bird then flies<br>
			(O1) if p then (deductively) r                 e.g., if penguin then bird<br>
			(M1) arguably, p                               e.g., arguably, penguin<br>
			(M2) R1 is a more specific reason than R2      e.g., R1 is better than R2<br>
			(M3) therefore, arguably, q                    e.g., therefore, arguably, not-flies<br>

			<h2>Nature of defeasibility</h2>
		</header>
		
		<p>
			There is a distinct difference between those who theorize about defeasible reasoning as if it were a system of confirmational revision (with affinities to belief revision), and those who theorize about defeasibility as if it were the result of further (non-empirical) investigation. There are at least three kinds of further non-empirical investigation: progress in a lexical/syntactic process, progress in a computational process, and progress in an adversary or legal proceeding.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b><i>Defeasibility as corrigibility:</i></b> Here, a person learns something new that annuls a prior inference. In this case, defeasible reasoning provides a constructive mechanism for belief revision, like a truth maintenance system as envisioned by Jon Doyle.
